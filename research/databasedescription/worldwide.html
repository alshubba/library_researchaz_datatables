The  database is building on the merged backfiles of Political Science  Abstracts, published by IFI/Plenum, 1975-2000, and ABC POL SCI,  published by ABC-CLIO, 1984-2000. Since 2000, development of the  serials list has focused on expanding international coverage. As of  August 2005 approximately 1,510 titles are being monitored for  coverage; of these, 67% are published outside the United States.</p>
