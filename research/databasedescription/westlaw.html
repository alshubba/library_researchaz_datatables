With Westlaw Campus, members of the Bentley community have access to the laws and statutes of the federal government and all 50 states.  All precedent-setting court decisions of the federal and state courts from the National Reporter System® are included in the database.  Patrons can also use the KeyCite® tool to research whether a case, statute, or regulation is still good law.  Reference resources in Westlaw Campus include American Law Reports, American Jurisprudence and articles from hundreds of leading law reviews and journals.</p>
