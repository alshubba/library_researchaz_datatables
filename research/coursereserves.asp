                  <p>Placing items on course reserve allows your instructor to provide access to the material required for assignments to all students enrolled in a particular class.
There are two types of course reserve collections:
<ul class="contentlist">
<li>Physical Reserves are a collection of printed material (books, journals, etc.) placed on course reserve by your instructor and made available for students to borrow for a limited period of time. Search here for items on physical reserve. You may search by instructor’s last name, or by course number.<br/><br/>
<div class="search">
<form action="http://libcat.bentley.edu/search/" method="get" style="margin-left:5px ;">
      <select id="el08" name="searchtype">
         <option value="p">Instructor (e.g., smith, jane)</option>
         <option value="r"> Course (e.g.,gb320)</option>
      </select>
                
      <input class="input" type="text" name="searcharg" size="27" maxlength="75" value="" />
      <input name="submit" class="button" type="submit" value="Search" />
   </form> 
   </div>
   </li>
  <div style="clear:both"></div>
   <li>Electronic Reserves or e-reserves are like physical reserves, except that your instructor posts readings electronically to your course’s Blackboard site for you to access.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <h2>Borrowing Physical Reserves</h2>
   <p>Reserve items are placed on reserve each semester/session and are located in the reserve stacks behind the Library Services desk.</p>
   <ul class="contentlist">
   <li>To borrow a reserve item, you must present your current Bentley University ID and provide to library staff the title of the item you wish to check out</li>
   <li>To find out what your instructor has placed on reserve, you can search the library’s online catalogue by either course number or instructor</li>
   <li>All physical reserve items will be removed from the reserve collection at the conclusion of the semester</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h2>Loan Periods for Physical Reserves</h2>
   <p>To ensure that every student is afforded access, loan periods on reserve items are typically very brief. They are determined by your instructor and can be any one of the following:
   <ul class="contentlist">
   <li>2-hours – library use only</li>
   <li>4-hours – library use only</li>
   <li>24-hours</li>
   <li>3-days</li>
   <li>1-week</li>
   </ul> 
   </p>
   <p>Reserve items cannot be renewed. </p>
   <h2>Fines for Overdue Physical Reserve Material</h2>
   <p>Because all material on course reserve needs to be available to a large number of students, overdue charges will be levied against items returned late. Students are responsible for the timely return of all reserve items borrowed, whether or not any reminder or notice is received from the library.</p>
   <ul class="contentlist">
   <li>Late charges are assessed for each item overdue at $1.00 per hour with a maximum fine of $28.00 per item</li>
   <li>There is no grace period for overdue reserve items</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessing E-Reserves</h2>
<ul class="contentlist">
<li>Assigned electronic reserve readings are available on your course’s Blackboard site. They are filed within a folder titled Electronic Reserves under the Course Documents tab</li>
<li>Electronic reserve readings can either be PDF documents of digitized print content or links to licensed electronic resources, in most cases e-journal articles</li>
<li>Access to electronic reserve readings will be terminated at the conclusion of the semester</li>
</ul>
