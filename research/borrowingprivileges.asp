                    <h2>Brandeis University Borrowing Cards</h2>
                    <p>
Faculty and students may use the Brandeis University borrowing cards to borrow materials from the Brandeis Library. Patrons are bound by the borrowing policies and rules of the Brandeis Library and are responsible for returning or paying any fines or fees that may have accrued. Members of the Bentley Community who borrow materials from Brandeis are responsible for returning said materials to the proper institution. The borrowing cards are circulated through the Bentley Library Services desk. Questions regarding borrowing cards should be directed to the Library Services Desk at 781.891.2168, or email us at <a href="mailto:libraryservices@bentley.edu">libraryservices@bentley.edu</a>.</p>
<h2>Waltham Public Library Borrowing Cards</h2>
<p>Bentley students can bring your Bentley ID card and an additional photo identification with your home address to receive a Library Card at the Waltham Public Library.  If you are living off-campus, you will also be required to verify your local address.  Student cards are valid until the first of May. If you are staying in Waltham for the summer, and can verify your summer address, your card may be extended until the first of September. You will be asked to verify your address again at the beginning of the new academic year.  More information is available at:  <a href="http://waltham.lib.ma.us/circulation/index.php#cards" target="_blank" class="external">http://waltham.lib.ma.us/circulation/index.php#cards</a></p>
<h2>Borrowing Cards for Bentley Faculty members</h2>
<p>Full-time Bentley faculty who would like to borrow research materials from one of these area libraries may apply for a borrowing card that is sponsored by the Bentley library. Please allow two to three business days for an e-mail response to your application.</p>
